# The Purple Mist Machine
A corona discharge generator that utilizes a cockroft-walton multiplier with a low voltage input of 6V DC with a total power input of 6W! The design is modular meaning that you can keep stacking the SAME PCB over and over again to increase the amount of stages! Each PCB contains 4 stages due to needing to properly insulate the high voltage.
