# The Purple Mist Machine
A corona discharge generator that utilizes a Cockroft-Walton multiplier with a voltage input around 1-2KV. The design is modular, meaning that you can keep stacking the same PCB over and over again to increase the number of stages. Each PCB contains 4 stages. The output should be in the range of tens of kilovolts, perfect for corona discharge. It is also at an extremely low current so it is not lethal.

# What is corona discharge?
Corona discharge is a purple glowing electrical discharge that occurs when high voltage is supplied to a conductor, which ionizes the surrounding air. A byproduct of this is ozone, or O3. This is actually how ozone generators function as well. Ozone is not good for your health although it is used to sterilize. It's a good idea to operate this by a window, with the built-in fan on while also not keeping it on for too long.

# Why did I design this?
Corona discharge was always super cool to me, when watching people like StyroPyro and Electroboom. Over time, I ended up just watching random informative videos about high voltage just for fun and I realized that I could build one myself. Plus, I don't have the risk of dying from this machine, because of the extremely low current!
