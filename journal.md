<h1>July 8th</h1>

First, I thought of the parts I would need and researched the circuit overall. I watched lots of youtube videos and read lots of things. I ended up going with a 6V DC PSU because the transformer that you'll hear about in a second was originally powered by 4 AA batteries in series, a 6V input and 2KV output transformer that I salvaged from a goodwill UVC wand for the overall input power. I went with ceramic capacitors rated for 5KV and a capacitance of 1nF, diodes rated for 5KV and 200mA. I also went with decently thick wire. After that, I started work on the schematic. It took me a while to really get it down even though it doesn't look like a lot, and I'm pretty proud of my first real PCB that wasn't a breakout board.

After that, I put the components on the PCB. I spaced them out a lot over a 99mmx99mm board because it needs a ton of insulation to not arc. Also, it'll stay cheap this way with my modular design where I can stack PCBs together, which will be the first time using all FIVE PCBs! Definitely the hardest part about all this was wiring the PCBs in a single layer design. FR4 is not able to handle this high of a voltage between layers and it would for sure arc, so I had to make it single layer. This also means it could be milled by a CNC mill which is pretty cool. The PCB isn't done yet of course, with polishing and silkscreen needing to be added.
